        <h1>New site!</h1>
        <p>
            So yeah, I made a new site. For those who don't know (everyone), I'm the dumbass who made a google sites page a few years back and got interested in website making.
            I wanted to make a website for free, because I really have no interest in spending money for stupid shit like this. I opted for a tk domain, netlify and vscode
            I knew for sure that I didn't want to use something like wordpress or google sites, because those are too limitive, and I learn basically nothing by using those.
            Everything is still a bit clunky, sorry for that. I will try to make stuff work in the course of the next few days. This is literally my first ever time writing javascript, so don't judge me if everything doesn't work like a charm.
            That is basically it then. I will work on the website, and will try to post more blog entries. Bye.
